Don't worry, just a repo I can push to for fun & profit.

[The Day Lady Died](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42657/the-day-lady-died)  
It is 12:20 in New York a Friday  
three days after Bastille day, yes  
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine  
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton  
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner  
and I don’t know the people who will feed me  


I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun  
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy  
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets   
in Ghana are doing these days
  I go on to the bank
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)     
doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life     
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine   
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do
